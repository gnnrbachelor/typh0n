The current rate of technological evolution in our world today is daunting. Three generations ago, my grandfather owned a saddle shop, now self driving cars are on the market. Everything about our experience of day to day life is changing rapidly. And yet, our power structures and institutions remain the same. This is a recipe for disaster.

Nowhere is this disparity more obvious than in the sphere of cybercrime.[By next year the total losses from cybercrime will exceed 6 trillion dollars.](https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/) [A cyber attack occurs every 39 seconds worldwide.](https://www.varonis.com/blog/cybersecurity-statistics/) Cybercrime is currently resulting in the greatest transfer of wealth in human history. Governments around the world cannot contain this problem.[Less than five percent of hackers ever get caught and prosecuted.](https://www.cybersecurityintelligence.com/blog/some-hackers-earn-2m-a-year-5083.html#:~:text=Only%20around%204%2F5%25%20of,arrest%20and%20prosecute%20these%20offenders.) Many nations don't even have laws to guard their citizens against cybercrime. Even those with appropriate legal infrastructure are helpless against international hackers. 

Adding to the problem, the barrier for entry in the field is low. Between 2001 and 2002, Gary Mckinnon hacked computers owned by the US military and NASA costing them over $700,000 in damage. He was no computer genius. He was systems administrator who had previously worked as a hairdresser. When asked for his motivation behind the attacks, he revealed an obsession with UFOs and free energy conspiracy theories.

We're entering a time when anybody with basic networking skills and an internet connection can challenge the most powerful goverments and corporations in the world. With global markets in decline, unemployment up, and outdated, ineffectual legal systems in place, a silent revolution will be taking place and our current institutions will watch helplessly as power shifts hands.  

I'm starting this blog with the intention of chronicling these changes as they happen and educating the public on cybersecurity issues. If you want to know how to survive in the coming era of technological chaos you're in the right place. Here I will include news, tech tutorials, and commentary on events as they develop.
