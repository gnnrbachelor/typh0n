These are a couple interviews of Don Webb, the former High Priest of the Temple of Set. Both interviewers are frightfully boring and unprepared. Mr. Webb is a brilliant author, teacher and occultist. These interviews should have been mind-blowing! If anyone is aware of other interviews available online I would appreciate sending them my way. If these truly are the best available I will work on contacting Mr. Webb myself and fixing that problem. His work "Uncle Setnakt's Essential Guide" upended everything I thought I knew about the occult. He deserves better promotion of his ideas. In the meantime, enjoy this imperfect interview.
