For centuries, devoted occultists have not been able to resist the urge to speculate on our collective spiritual evolution and its impact on society. Occult politics. This talk from Gary Lachmann provides an excellent starting point for thinking about these topics. His politics are nothing particularly unconventional (unfortunately) but I'm glad to see someone thinking on the subject. Enjoy.
