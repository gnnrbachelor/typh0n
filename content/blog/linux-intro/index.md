If you want control over your digital life, it's time to switch to Linux. Every other platform owns your data. Your computer is your life. It deserves the attention that your bank account and credit cards get. [Google](https://www.komando.com/security-privacy/stop-google-tracking/760250/), [Apple](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2019/07/30/confirmed-apple-caught-in-siri-privacy-scandal-let-contractors-listen-to-private-voice-recordings/?sh=74c57f3a7314), and [Microsoft](https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/250-million-microsoft-customer-service-records-exposed-exactly-how-bad-was-it/) all habitually misuse their customers data. Linux is the only solution for the security-minded. If this core fact isn't enough to convince you to make the switch, here's three more reasons Linux beats the competition for the informed consumer.

##1. It's Free and Open Source.  
Linux is completely free and open source. The battle is over between proprietary vs open source software. [Open source wins everytime.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-and-open-source-have-won-get-over-it/) Leading tech companies know this. Apple, Google, and Microsoft have made billions off the Linux operating system. It's stable, customizable and it runs on everything from laptops and desktops, to mobile phones, servers, and IOT devices. In fact, if you have an old Windows system slowly grinding to a halt, converting it to Linux is your best bet for reclaiming speed and reliability. 
##2. Privacy & Security. 
Microsoft has long been known as the most vunerable operating system on the market. Security patches for known viruses and vunerabilities can take weeks to months to become available. Meanwhile, consumers and businesses dependendent on their systems just have to cross their fingers and wait. Linux was designed prioritizing security, and it's code is freely available for anyone to inspect and find bugs and vunerabilities. This is the beauty of open source. When errors do occur they are caught quickly and patched in hours, not months.    
##3. Active Community.
The Linux community is passionate about what they do. Linux development is a labor of love. New free software is created and upgraded daily. Nearly every piece of proprietary software available on a Windows or Mac system has a free alternative in the Linux cosmos. Whatever you want to do with your system, chances are Linux has you covered for free. Resources to learn their system are provided in abundance online at no cost. The Linux community is unparalleled in it's dedication to bringing open source to every new enthusiast. We're always looking for converts. 

Here I've linked some resources for downloading, installing, and mastering Linux for yourself.[You can download a copy now and have it running on your computer in an hour](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
