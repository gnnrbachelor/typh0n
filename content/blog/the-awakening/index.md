Every human wants to be a god. We are driven from within toward greater expansion of the Self. More power. More knowledge. Greater awakening. Our earliest ancestors with moon-light sacrificial rituals and the modern psychonaut hypnotically tripping to EDM have the same goal. Self-deification. 

No one wants to be a slave. And yet the world is filled with religions, institutions, and traditions that train us to be docile, subservient, and domesticated. Politicians have functioned as parasites on human development and evolution. Priests have deceived, manipulated,and disguised the truth. Our educational institutions have lobotomized the human soul according the whims of whatever ruling class holds sway at any given phase of our history. Everything in our soul cries out for freedom, everything in our civilized life keeps us in a cage.

We must ask ourselves, what would it be like to truly experience psychic freedom? Free from religious, social, and psychic dogma, experiencing the entire Cosmos as our Self. Why have so few asked the question? Do we even have the imagination to consider the possibilities?

In traditional Judeo-Christian mythology the Serpent was a figure of evil, coaxing Eve from a state of pristine happiness into chaos and destruction. "Ye shall be as gods" (Genesis 3:5). Let's consider an another interpretation. Was it not a call toward Enlightenment? A call away from the slavery of animal experience to that of Transcendence and Awakening. Perhaps the Serpent was Prometheus bringing the Divine Fire down to animal man.

There is a reactionary myth shaping common interpretations of Mystical Experience. Every religion on the planet has ruled the testimony of our ancestors as purer and more authentic than our own. We stand know in the postmodern era, where all mythologies stand in utterly shattered by the weight of science, reason, and historical examination.  Is is not time to consider radical possibilities. It is becoming the duty of the modern mystic to see further than our ancestors could. Our mythologies must be our own. Our techniques for advancing Consciousness will not be the same as past traditions. 

Why should we ever have concluded that Enlightenment could be attained by following a list of codified teachings and dogmas. Why should Wisdom be attained by the cowardly conformists that such an approach would attract? Truth is for the courageous, the daring, the intellectually strong. Unbridled by tradition, taboos, or dogma, a whole new generation of spiritual seekers must conduct experiments in Consciousness. Let us drop acid, munch shrooms, biohack our brains, meditate in sensory deprivation tanks. May EDM clubs become spaces of psychic transformation. May new cults and grottos open in place of ancient Cathedrals. May there be no limit what we're willing to in driving our collective and individual Consciousness to the very heights of sublime experience. 

These series of essays are articulating conceptual starting points for postmodern magickians, techno-pagans, psychonauts, luciferian . Here I will discuss the Occult, Psychonautics, Magick, Entheogens, and their connection to Art and Creativity. To stay up to date with my work. Follow me on Twitter.
